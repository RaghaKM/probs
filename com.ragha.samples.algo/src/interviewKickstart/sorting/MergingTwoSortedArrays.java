	 * You're given two sorted arrays: 
	1. Array 1, size 'N', which has N sorted positive integers 
	2. Array2, size '2N' (twice the size of first), which also has only N sorted positive integers in its first half. Second half of this array is empty. (Empty elements are marked by 0). 

		Write a function that takes these two arrays, and merges the first one into second one, resulting in one fully sorted array of 2N elements. 

	Constraints: You can use only constant extra space. Need a linear solution. Repeats are allowed. Only positive non-zero integers are found in input. O denotes an empty space.
